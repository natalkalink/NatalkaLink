# Hi, I'm NatalkaLink! 

I am a Frontend Developer with a background in choral conducting. This experience taught me to manage complex systems and understand that in software, as in music, every detail matters for the final result.
I enjoy combining design and clean code to build responsive, user-friendly websites. I care about structure, details, and learning new things to keep growing and improving my work.

### My Approach:

#### Structure: 
I focus on building clean, scalable architecture. Just like in an ensemble, every element must be in its place to create harmony.

#### Style: 
I believe that minimalist aesthetics combined with logical structure create the most intuitive user experiences.

#### Growth Mindset: 
I am currently deep-diving into JavaScript fundamentals and preparing for my next step — the React ecosystem.

### Open to Collaboration:
As a musician, I highly value professional critique and mentorship. I believe that constructive feedback is the shortest path to excellence and clean code.
